# Terraform AWS Experiments üöÄ

## Overview
This repository contains a series of Terraform-based labs focused on learning and deploying AWS infrastructure. The projects start from beginner-level deployments (like EC2 instances) and progress towards more advanced setups using Terraform modules and remote backends.

## üéØ Goals
- Build hands-on expertise with Terraform and AWS services.
- Learn infrastructure as code (IaC) best practices.
- Implement modular and production-like Terraform code.
